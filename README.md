## Code

### Requirement
- Python 3.5
- Tensorflow 1.8
- [PyDenseCRF](https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/pydensecrf)

### Setup
Partial coda and data preparation are borrowed from [TF-phrasecut-public](https://github.com/chenxi116/TF-phrasecut-public). Please follow their instructions to make your setup ready. DeepLab backbone network is based on [TF-deeplab ](https://github.com/chenxi116/TF-deeplab) as well as the pretrained model for initializing weights of our model. 

### Sample code
#### Training
```
python main_cmsa.py -m train -w deeplab -d Gref -t train -g 0 -i 800000
```


#### Testing 
```
python main_cmsa.py -m test -w deeplab -d Gref -t val -g 0 -i 800000
```
